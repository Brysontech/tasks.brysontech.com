                    We originally built this application to help manage our 
                    'in-house' projects and activities and a couple weeks ago we 
                    received a request to make it public.  There's a comments 
                    section at the bottom to leave feedback, but the best feedback 
                    is from subscribing and using the application. <br />
                    ENJOY!
